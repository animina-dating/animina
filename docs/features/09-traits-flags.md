## 3.1 Flag Types (Three Colors)

## 3.2 Flag Categories
Flags are organized into semantic categories:
- Character (honesty, courage, resilience, etc.)
- Lifestyle
- Hobbies & Interests
- Values
- And more...

See [Appendix B: Flags](appendix-b-flags.md) for the complete list of 217 flags organized by category.

## 3.3 Flag Selection Rules
- Configurable maximum number of flags per color
- Position/order indicates importance (first = most important)
- Same flag cannot have multiple colors for the same user
- Some flags are "photo-flaggable" (can be applied to photos)

## 3.4 Flag Matching
- System identifies intersecting flags between users
- Shows which white flags (about me) overlap
- Shows which of user A's green flags match user B's white flags
- Detects red flag conflicts (incompatibilities)
