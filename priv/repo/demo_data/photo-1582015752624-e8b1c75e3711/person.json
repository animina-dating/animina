Walking through the remnants of ancient civilizations, from the Acropolis in Athens to the ruins of Delphi, I felt a deep connection to the past. One highlight was standing in the shadow of the Parthenon, imagining the grandeur of ancient Athens. Another unforgettable moment was sailing to the island of Santorini, where the sunset over the caldera painted the sky in brilliant hues.
