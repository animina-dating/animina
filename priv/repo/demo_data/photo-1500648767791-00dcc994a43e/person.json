  "favorite_travel_story": "Volunteering in a medical camp in rural Nepal was a humbling and rewarding experience. The mountainous landscapes, coupled with the warm hospitality of the locals, made it a memorable trip. I provided medical care to communities with limited access to healthcare, learning about their culture and resilience. One day, I hiked to a remote village, carrying supplies and offering treatment to those in need. The trip was a blend of professional dedication and personal growth, leaving me with a deep appreciation for the spirit and strength of the Nepali people.",
